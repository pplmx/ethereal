This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces for the Desktop Ethereal project that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility, transparent window context).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, etc.) that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. For a desktop application, consider system fonts that work well with transparency and small UI elements.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Consider the desktop context - the UI should work well over various backgrounds.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families, cliched color schemes, predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

## Desktop Application Considerations

Special considerations for Desktop Ethereal as a desktop companion application:

- **Transparent Window Context**: The application lives in a transparent window that can be click-through. Design elements should work well with this constraint.
- **Small UI Footprint**: The application window is small (300x300px). Every pixel matters.
- **Overlay Aesthetics**: The UI overlays the desktop, so contrast and legibility are crucial.
- **System Integration**: The application should feel like a native part of the system, not an intrusive element.
- **Performance**: Desktop overlays should be lightweight and not impact system performance.

## Sprite Animation Design

Special considerations for sprite-based animations:

- **Frame Consistency**: All animation frames should have consistent sizing and positioning.
- **Looping**: Animations should loop seamlessly.
- **Performance**: Sprite animations should be lightweight and not impact system performance.
- **Thematic Consistency**: All sprites should follow a consistent artistic style.
